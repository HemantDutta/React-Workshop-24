### Starter React App

The `starter-app` folder contains a basic React project to demonstrate the initial structure and setup of a React application. This was used to show how to set up a React app for development, including installing dependencies, starting the development server, and explaining the file structure.


**How to Use:**

1. Navigate to the `starter-app` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

### Finished React App

The `finished-app` folder contains a more comprehensive React application with several components and pages. This app demonstrates various essential React concepts, such as:

- **State Management**: Using `useState()`.
- **Side Effects**: Utilizing `useEffect()`.
- **Routing**: Implementing client-side routing with `react-router-dom`.
- **API Calls**: Fetching data with Axios.
- **Data Rendering**: Using `.map()` to render lists.
- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **Reusable Components**: Creating components that can be reused across different parts of the app.
- **Nested Components**: Structuring components in a nested manner for better organization.


**How to Use:**

1. Navigate to the `finished-app` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

### Node Express Server

The `node-express-server` folder contains a basic Node.js and Express server used during the workshop. This server was used to demonstrate API calls and data handling in React applications.

**APIs Provided:**

- **GET `/data`**: Sends JSON data used to demonstrate data rendering in React.
- **POST `/login`**: Demonstrates making POST API calls and handling login functionality in React.


**How to Use:**

1. Navigate to the `node-express-server` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.
